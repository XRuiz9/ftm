# The Currently Untitled Project That Was Formerly Known as "From Teen Mom"
It just sounded far too serious.

## Womb

### Womb V1.0 - Final Crit Release
This is the first complete release that was available to the public, and it was completed in a whirlwind of a 24 hour period before my final crit on April 12th. After pulling an all-nighter, I truly could not comprehend anything the critics said, but they seemed intrigued. They said it raised a lot of interesting questions about proximity, bodily presence and autonomy. Of the few critiques I could parse, these are the significant things that I noticed needed to be changed.

1. It needed to be louder: They went on and on about how the audio needed more of a presence. Too bad I didn't turn the headset on to max volume. Still, there is a chance I may need to go back into the audio files and play with volume levels.
2. The womb needed to be centered and the tracking needed to be changed: Because people were repeatedly getting in the headset as soon as other people had gotten out, not sitting through the entire experience, and were different heights, they'd go into the experience, and the womb would be in a place where the chair was not. This may also be a result of me turning off the guardian, which was absolutely essential to making sure oculus did not lose it's tracking while people sat in the chair and kicking them out of the experience.
3. It needed to loop: This needed to happen anyway. I kind of just forgot to add this before the crit, but like I said before, people were entering and leaving the experience much faster than I anticipated, and so three people sat in it before the experience had even finished, and the last person went in after all the audio had played, so they just kind of say inside a silent womb.

## Midway Demo
This is a demo for the first half of my year-long thesis project. This demo served as a proof-of-concept for what I was trying to explore in the relationship between physical and digital sculpture. It is meant to be experienced in tandem with a physical sculpture that exists in real-life, a pink pillow that is also present in the VR experience.

The features are as follows:

Right index-finger pinch: Instantiate pillow
Right middle-finger pinch: Clear all pillows
Left index-finger pinch: Lock instantiation
Left middle-finger pinch: Unlock instantiation
